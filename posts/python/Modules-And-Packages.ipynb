    "This article aims to deepen our understanding of Python's modules and packages and the machinery involved, helping me become a more effective Python programmer. We will explore their structure and functionality, covering everything from the basics of importing to creating custom packages and managing dependencies. By unpacking the underlying machinery of how modules/packages get imported and what they really are, we'll gain insights that will enhance our coding practices and project organization."

    "- Python has only one type of module object regardless of the language the module was implemented it (C/Python/...)\n",
    "- Package provides a naming hierarchy to organize modules (same analogy to directory in Unix file system):\n",
    "    - All packages are modules but not all modules are packages\n",
    "    - A module is a package that has `__path__`\n",
    "    - A package can include subpackages (sub-directories)\n",
    "- There are two types of packages:\n",
    "    - **Regular packages** are directories that have `__init__.py`. When importing a package/subpackage -> implicitly executes all `__init__.py` files on the path and bound objects to names in the package's namespace\n",
    "        - When import machinery is looking for the package, it stops once it finds it\n",
    "    - **Namespace packages** are directories that don't have `__init__.py`\n",
    "        - When import machinery is looking for the package, it does not stop when it finds it and assuming there may be a regular package in some other paths in `sys.path` but keep a record of all namespace packages it found during the search. If it finds a regular package with that name -> discard all namespace packages it found and import the regular package. If it doesn't find any regular package with that name -> Use all the namespace packages it found during the search and combine their paths in `namespace_path` so when we try to import subpackage or modules, it checks all the paths in the namespace_path (which is a list)\n",
    "        - There can be multiple packages of the same name (under different directories) -> They are all combined together and the `namespace_path` list would have the path for all of them. Therefore, the same package can be used to refer to completely different modules in different directories\n",
    "        - Python first scans the whole sys.path before deciding that the package is a namespace -> If any name is found with `__init__.py` in it, it will give this priority and don't continue.\n",
    "- When importing subpackages such as `foo.bar.baz`, Python first imports foo, then foo.bar, then foo.bar.baz\n",
    "    - Each of these will be cached in `sys.modules`\n",
    "- `__init__.py` makes a directory a python package\n",
    "    - We can use it to import useful stuff from different modules/subpackages so it can be available to user\n",
    "    - When importing an object, it has `__module__` attribute which determines the global environment for the object\n",
    "    - We can define `__all__` in `__init__` as concatenation of all `__all__` in modules\n",
    "        - Example: `__all__ = foo.__all__ + bar.__all__` BUT we need to either first import foo and bar or import anything from them so they can be defined such as `from .foo import *` OR `from .foo import y`\n",
    "    - `__init__` can be used to also initialize things and maybe monkeypatch some other modules\n",
    "- Each package has `__path__` attribute that helps when searching for subpackages. This will be given to path finder when loading subpackages\n",
    "    - It is a list; similar to `sys.path` so we can change it. But it is not recommended\n",
    "    - Example: `import math; math.__path__.append(~/Documents\")`\n",
    "- Relative import is preferred to absolute imports inside packages to avoid having issues if the package name is changed\n",
    "- Packages get loaded once even if we import it multiple times\n",
    "- We can in theory upgrade a package in the cache like this:\n",
    "    - `sys.modules[new_name] = package_name`\n",
    "- If we use `python -m package.module`, it executes module as the main program and **relative imports** works. Otherwise, relative imports won't work.\n",
    "    - `m` stands for module\n",
    "- The `__main__` module is a special case relative to Pythonâ€™s import system. The `__main__` module is directly initialized at interpreter startup, much like `sys` and `builtins`. The manner in which `__main__` is initialized depends on the flags and other options with which the interpreter is invoked\n",
    "- `__main__.py` designates main for a package/subpackage and also allows package directory to be executable -> explicitly marks the entry point. Examples:\n",
    "    - `python package` would look for `__main__.py` to execute it\n",
    "    - `python -m package.subpackage` would look for `__main__.py` inside package/subpackage to execute\n",
    "    - `__package__` is set so the relative imports still work\n",
    "    - A lot of programming tools utilize this to their own benefit: `python -m profile script.y` OR `python -m pdb script.py`\n",
    "    - NOTE THAT `__init__.py` files on the path will still be executed\n",
    "- Depending on how `__main__` is initialized, `__main__.__spec__` gets set appropriately or to None.\n",
    "    - When Python is started with the -m option, `__spec__` is set to the module spec of the corresponding module or package. `__spec__` is also populated when the `__main__` module is loaded as part of executing a directory, zipfile or other sys.path entry.\n",
    "    - Otherwise, it will be set to None\n",

    "    - All third libraries will be installed in site-packages directory\n",

    "- Files with `.pth` extension in site-packages directory get added to the sys.path. We can list directories in those files that will be added to sys.path for any new instance of Python\n",

Basically Python doesn't try to clean up the dictionary from the old module, but instead exec() the new state of the module using the old `module.__dict__`. This means stuff from previous load may still exist and we end up having weird cases. This is how Python reloads a module:\n",

       " '\\npandas - a powerful data analysis and manipulation library for Python\\n=====================================================================\\n\\n**pandas** is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data\\nstructures designed to make working with \"relational\" or \"labeled\" data both\\neasy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for\\ndoing practical, **real world** data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has\\nthe broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source data\\nanalysis / manipulation tool available in any language**. It is already well on\\nits way toward this goal.\\n\\nMain Features\\n-------------\\nHere are just a few of the things that pandas does well:\\n\\n  - Easy handling of missing data in floating point as well as non-floating\\n    point data.\\n  - Size mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and\\n    higher dimensional objects\\n  - Automatic and explicit data alignment: objects can be explicitly aligned\\n    to a set of labels, or the user can simply ignore the labels and let\\n    `Series`, `DataFrame`, etc. automatically align the data for you in\\n    computations.\\n  - Powerful, flexible group by functionality to perform split-apply-combine\\n    operations on data sets, for both aggregating and transforming data.\\n  - Make it easy to convert ragged, differently-indexed data in other Python\\n    and NumPy data structures into DataFrame objects.\\n  - Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large\\n    data sets.\\n  - Intuitive merging and joining data sets.\\n  - Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets.\\n  - Hierarchical labeling of axes (possible to have multiple labels per tick).\\n  - Robust IO tools for loading data from flat files (CSV and delimited),\\n    Excel files, databases, and saving/loading data from the ultrafast HDF5\\n    format.\\n  - Time series-specific functionality: date range generation and frequency\\n    conversion, moving window statistics, date shifting and lagging.\\n')"
