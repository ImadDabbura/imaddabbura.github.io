    "**Git** is a distributed version control system that thinks/stores it data as a series of snapshots (not delta). Each commit is a snapshot for the state of the system at the time of the commit. For files that haven't changed, *Git* doesn't store the file again but uses a pointer to the previous identical file that it stored before. It also lets us do almost all operations locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything in *Git* is checksummed before it is stores in its object store using `SHA-1` hash. `SHA-1` hash returns 40 hexadecimal characters. All objects are referred to by their checksummed because *Git* is content addressable filesystem. This means that Git notice any changes to the files it tracks by comparing the checksummed of the stored version vs the current version.\n",
    "\n",
    "All actions in *Git* only add data to the object store (Git database). Therefore, it is almost impossible to not undo any operation especially if we regularly push our Git database to other repository such as *Github*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git has three states:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modified**: file changed but not yet committed.\n",
    "- **Staged**: marked changed file to go to next commit snapshot. Staging area is a single file that is typically called \"index\", which stores information about what will go into our next commit snapshot. When we run `git add file`, Git does the following:\n",
    "    - Computes checksum of the file and store the SHA-1 value in index file.\n",
    "    - Compress the contents of the file and store it in `.git` directory under `objects` where the first two characters of the checkum would be the name of the directory and the next 38 characters would be the name of the file.\n",
    "    - Add the checksum to the index file (staging area)\n",
    "- **Committed**: store data (snapshot) in the database. The snapshot is represented as tree for root directory of the Git project. When we run `git commit`, Git does the following:\n",
    "    - It computes checksum of each subdirectory until we end up with the root directory.\n",
    "    - Stores them as tree objects in Git repository\n",
    "    - Finally, Git create a commit object and store it in the Git repository with the following metadata:\n",
    "        - Date\n",
    "        - Author name\n",
    "        - Committer name\n",
    "        - Commit message\n",
    "        - Parent(s) commit. First commit would have no parents. Following commits may have 1 parent or more parents in the case of merges\n",
    "        - Pointer to the root project tree\n",
    "\n",
    "`.git` directory which is at the root directory of the project has all the metadata for Git project such as the database (object store).\n",
    "\n",
    "Files can be in two states:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **UnTracked**: files that Git doesn't know about. They are files that weren't in any snapshot or in staging area. Therefore, they don't have modified/unmodified states.\n",

    "- `heads` aka branches (because it is a collection of HEADS for each branch in Git repo) are nothing but pointers to commits. They are very simple objects, they only contain hash_value of the commit they are pointing to. Therefore, creating a branch is just creating a file in `refs/heads` with the name of the branch that has the commit of the HEAD of that branch. At the beginning, this file will have the commit the HEAD points to from the branch you were on when created the branch.\n",
    "- When you switch branches, Git resets your working directory to look like it did the last time you committed on that branch. It adds, removes, and modifies files automatically to make sure your working copy is what the branch looked like on your last commit to it.\n",

    "    - If we are merging a feature branch into master branch and the feature branch is directly ahead of master where master's last commit can be reached following feature branch commit's history, Git will do fast-forward merge, which means it just updates the pointer to point forward.\n",

    "        - Creates a new snapshot with new commit object (**merge commit**) that points to two parents: last commit from master and last commit from feature branches\n",
    "    - If we have merge conflict, we can either abort the merge or resolve the merge conflist ourselves. Once we resolve the conflicts in all files, we should stage those files and then commit the changes. This would be the merge commit. We can use mergetool to resolve merge conflicts such as `vimdiff`.\n",

They’re checksummed; contain the tagger name, email, and date; have a tagging message; and can be signed and verified with GNU Privacy Guard (GPG).

   "source": [
    "- __Checkout__: `git checkout -b new-branch` First Git will follow from the HEAD to the current branch to determine what commit hash that branch points at. With that info, Git creates a new file in .git/refs/heads with our new branch name as the file name, and the commit hash as the contents. Lastly, it updates HEAD to point at this new ref.\n",
    "- __Verbose Checkout__: `git checkout -b new-branch master` It is almost the same as the previous checkout, but instead of starting from `HEAD`, it starts from the base branch we provided which is `master` in this case.\n",
    "- __Checkout a File__: `git checkout commit/refs -- file_name` This will look at the tree that the commit is pointing at (in the case of refs, it looks first for the commit that the refs is pointing at), then walking down the tree to get to the blob for the file and restore that version of that file.\n",
    "- __Committing__: `git commit -m \"test\"` When we commit, It involves at least a change to one blob. This will lead to a creation of new tree with current state of the code that reflect the changes. Git then creates commit object that will point to the new tree. Finally, it will update the current branch to point to the newly created branch.\n",
    "- __Fast-Forward Merge__: `git merge --ff-only branch-name` This kind of merge creates no objects, It just updates the current branch to a different commit.\n",
    "- __Merge__: `git merge branch-name` In contrast to the fast forward merge, Git creates a new tree by trying its best to combine two divergent branches. It then creates a new commit that point to the newly created tree and the parent would be the two commits; latest commit from each branch. This is what _merging using pull requests_ does on Github. It may not be preferable because the actual code changes during merge when Git tries to combine all of them and we may end up with conflict.\n",
    "- __Rebase__: `git rebase master` Rebase can be performed when we have new commits on both our feature branch, and our \"upstream\" branch (typically master). We want to update the commits on our branch so they include the changes on master. When we rebase, we essentially replay our work on the current version of the upstream branch. Git does this by calculating each of the diffs for the commits unique to our branch, then applies them onto the upstream branch one by one. Each application of a diff creates a new commit, reusing the associated commit message and author details. Note that the old commits still exist, but they are now orphaned. No refs point to them any longer and so they are essentially unreachable, although we could easily restore them by checking the reflog. Once all the new commits have been created, our branch is updated to point at the tip commit of our rebased group. From here, we could now fast-forward merge the master branch into ours, as we are now in line with its history. The key difference between this and a traditional merge is that all of the commits here were created by us, and we get to interact with them and test them as needed before merging them into master.\n",
    "- __Interactive Rebase__: `git rebase -i master` This mainly happens when we are on a feature branch that is ahead of master and we want to combine both branches w/o incorporating all the commits from feature branch. In this case, we want to squash all the commits in the feature branch into one commit that will be later part of the master branch and not pollute the logs on master branch with a lot small incremental commits from the feature branch. Note that interactive rebase doesn't change any code, it only cleans up history."

    "- The `gitconfig` file is where Git stores and reads all configuration. The file lives in your home directory as a \"dotfile\", ~/.gitconfig. The gitconfig file is read automatically before any Git command is run. That turns out to be very handy as it means you never have to reload or experience out-of-sync commands. Additionally, git automatically writes to it when we run commands like git config --global alias.ga.\n",
    "- The config file is split into sections such as _color, alias, core, push, etc._ For example:\n",

    "```\n",
    "is the same as git config --global push.default upstream.\n",
    "- Few useful configurations:\n",
    "    - `push.default upstream` this instructs Git how to respond when you run git push with no arguments. With the upstream configuration, it will push the configured upstream tracking branch (set up with git push -u).\n",
    "    - `merge.ff only` this configuration tells Git to reject merges that are non-fastforward. With fast-forward merges, no new commits are created, but instead the merging branch (typically master) is only moved to point at the commits on the target branch (typically our feature branch).\n",
    "    - `fetch.prune true` this instructs Git to clear local references to remote branches which have been deleted when you pull.\n",
    "- By default, we can only execute one git command when aliasing. To execute more than one command, we can start the command with `!` and then we can execute multiple shell commands using pipes, &&, and ||. For example, `!git checkout master && git pull && git checkout -`.\n",
    "- __Git subcommands__: This would allow us to write scripts in any language we want; not necessarily bash, and make Git executes it. The script subcommand has to be:\n",
    "    - On our $PATH\n",
    "    - Marked as executable\n",
    "    - The file name has to be prefixed with git and then dash and then the name of the command. For example, `git-subcommand-name`. Actually, all git commands are files that share all those criteria such as `git-add`. Below is an example of subcommand:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    #!/bin/bash\n",
    "    #\n",
    "    # Small wrapper around git commit. Bare 'cm' will enter normal git commit\n",
    "    # editor, but with args it will do a direct `commit -m`\n",
    "\n",
    "    if [[ $# > 0 ]]; then\n",

    "    else\n",
    "        git commit -v\n",
    "    fi\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- __Hooks__: Hooks are scripts that can be set to run in response to certain events in Git such as before committing or after checkout. Some uses might be to enforce certain commit message standards on pushed commits, or to run the tests before committing.

    "    - We then have two choices to open PRs: Either through Github UI or though command line tools like `hub` and `gh`. The advantage of Github UI is that it lets you review the code one more time through compare view before submitting it.\n",
    "    - Provide as much context as possible when drafting your PR description. Try to provide as much useful detail as you can. Answering the following questions is a great start:\n",
    "        - Why is this change needed?\n",
    "        - Were other solutions considered?\n",
    "        - Were any assumptions made?\n",
    "    - For work that can't be broken down into small changes, we can use Github Task lists that shows all the items that need to be worked on and the methodology so that people would know not to do in depth code reviews. So every time we push changes we mark items that were already done.\n",

    "        - [thoughtbot guide to code review](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/code-review)\n",
    "    - After getting the feedback from the team on the code reviews as well as the CI comments, we can incorporate the changes that team recommended. Then push the new commits to the feature branch and those will automatically be included in the PR.\n",
    "    - We prefer a clean history built using fast-forward merges. In order to ensure this, before merging our PR we always pull master and rebase our feature branch onto master to ensure that our commits are ahead of master.

    "    - Once we're ahead of master, we can perform an interactive rebase to revise our commits and craft our history. In particular, we can use this time to squash down cleanup and WIP commits, ensuring that each commit we keep is useful and has a solid commit message.\n",

    "    - Final steps:\n",
    "        - If we've force pushed after rebasing as described above, we should be all set, but never hurts to give one last git push just to confirm that our local and remote feature branches are in sync.\n",
    "        - Merge fast-forward: `git co master` & `git merge - --ff-only`\n",
    "        - Push master: Now that we've merged master, we can push it up to GitHub with git push. As a reminder, with a fast-forward merge we are simply moving our master branch pointer to point at our feature branches tip commit, not actually creating any new commits. This is one of the main benefits of using fast-forward merges, namely that all commits are created and can be reviewed on our feature branch before merging into master. With \"Big Green Button on GitHub\" merges and other non-fast-forward merges, the merge commit is created directly on master based on Git's merging algorithm.\n",
    "        - Delete local branch: `git branch -d decks-ordering`\n",
    "        - Delete remote branch: `git push origin --delete <branchName>`. We can also delete the branch via the GitHub PR page, and then git pull on master, letting the fetch prune setting automatically clean up our local reference to the remote branch.\n",
    "        - Pull request auto closing. Assuming we've performed the steps outlined above, GitHub will have automatically closed the PR based on the fact that master now contains our branch's commits."
