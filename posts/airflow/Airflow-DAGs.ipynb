    "- `DAG()` class is needed to instantiate a **DAG** which will be the starting point of any workflow.\n",
    "    - The required arguments are: `dag_id` which is the name Airflow web UI uses to display workflow. `start_date` which is when to start running the workflow, it can be in the past\n",
    "    - There are other arguments such as `schedule_interval` which determines the schedule to rerun the DAG\n",
    "- `Operator` is responsible for a piece of work and almost represents a task.\n",
    "    - It has `task_id` which is the name web UI uses to display the task\n",
    "    - There are many operators such as `BashOperator`, `PythonOperator` ... All of them inherits from `BaseOperator`\n",
    "    - Some operators are generic such as `BashOperator` and some are specific such as `EmailOperator`\n",
    "- `Task` is a wrapper/manager over operator that makes sure the operator gets executed\n",
    "- `>>` represents the dependencies between tasks\n",
    "    - `a` >> `b` means `a` should run before `b`\n",
    "- Airflow UI offers two views:\n",
    "    - **tree view** that shows the DAG runs over time. Each column is one run. Each row is a task. So we can inspect status of tasks over time\n",
    "    - **graph view** that shows the DAG as a graph which helps showing the dependencies of tasks in the workflow\n",
    "- If any task failed, all successive tasks that depend on it don't run\n",
    "    - We can rerun the failed tasks (which also would cause successive tasks to rerun) w/o having to rerun the workflow from scratch\n",
    "    - We can inspect the logs to see what was the reason for the errors\n",
    "- Tasks can run in parallel depending on their dependencies"
