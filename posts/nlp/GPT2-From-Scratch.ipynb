    "There's an old saying in engineering: \"You don't really understand something until you can build it.\" This has never been more true than in the era of LLMs. While we've previously explored the foundational concepts in my post on the Transformer architecture [explained here](https://imaddabbura.github.io/posts/nlp/Transformer-Architecture-Explained.html), true understanding comes from implementation. That's why today, we're building a GPT-style model (the 124M variant) from scratch in PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project has a different focus than my last \"from scratch\" endeavor, where I built an [entire deep learning framework](https://github.com/ImadDabbura/tiny-pytorch) to grasp the low-level mechanics of autograd and tensor ops. Here, we'll leverage PyTorch's battle-tested primitives to focus on what makes GPT special: multi-head attention, positional encodings, and the specific architectural decisions that enable language understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "This hands-on process reveals challenges you can't appreciate from diagrams alone. You’ll watch your GPU memory overflow, see training grind to a halt from inefficient data loading, and learn firsthand why techniques like mixed-precision training, gradient accumulation, and activation checkpointing are necessities, not just optimizations. It's in facing these hurdles that you truly appreciate the engineering craft required to build and scale transformers efficiently."

    "GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models, developed by OpenAI, represent a breakthrough in natural language processing. GPT-2, released in 2019, demonstrated that a transformer-based model trained on vast amounts of text could generate remarkably coherent and contextually relevant content. GPT-3, its successor, scaled this approach to 175 billion parameters, showcasing emergent capabilities like few-shot learning and complex reasoning. Both models share the same fundamental architecture: stacked transformer decoder blocks that predict the next token in a sequence, trained on the simple objective of minimizing prediction error across massive text corpora. The 124M parameter version we'll be building captures the essential architecture while remaining computationally tractable for individual developers—though even at this \"small\" scale, you'll quickly discover why the ML community spends so much time optimizing both training efficiency and model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this journey, you won't just know how transformers work—you'll have built the critical components with your own hands, optimized the training loop, and watched your model evolve from random noise to coherent text generation. Let's begin."

    "Throughout this implementation, every piece of code will be thoroughly annotated with explanations of not just what we're doing, but why we're doing it. More importantly, we'll use few optimizations that make a big difference in terms of computational efficiency:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TensorFloat32 (TF32)**: NVIDIA's precision format that uses 19 bits of precision instead of 23, providing up to 8x speedup on A100 GPUs while maintaining model quality. We'll see how a single line of code can dramatically accelerate matrix multiplications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BFloat16 with Autocast**: Mixed precision training using brain floating-point format, which maintains the same exponent range as FP32 but reduces mantissa precision. Combined with automatic mixed precision (AMP), this cuts memory usage in half and speeds up training significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **torch.compile**: PyTorch 2.0's just-in-time compilation that fuses operations and generates optimized kernels. We'll explore how graph compilation can provide 10-30% speedups with minimal code changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flash Attention and Online Softmax**: An algorithmic improvement that computes attention without materializing the full attention matrix, reducing memory complexity from O(n²) to O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fused AdamW**: A single-kernel implementation of the AdamW optimizer that reduces memory reads/writes by computing all parameter updates in one pass, providing up to 2x optimizer step speedup.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Annealed Learning Rate**: Starting with a warmup phase followed by cosine decay, we'll implement the learning rate schedule that has become standard for training transformers, understanding why stable training requires careful lr management.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weight Decay Only on Matrices**: A subtle but crucial detail—applying weight decay only to weight matrices in Linear and Embedding layers while excluding biases and layer normalization parameters, which improves model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP)**: Scaling training across multiple GPUs using PyTorch's DDP, including gradient synchronization, proper data loading, and the intricacies of maintaining consistent model states across devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, since the GPT-2 paper omits certain architectural details and hyperparameter specifications, we'll refer to the GPT-3 paper to fill these gaps—fortunately, the core architecture remains consistent between the two models, making the GPT-3 paper a reliable source for these missing implementation details."

    "We've come a long way in this journey—from implementing the core transformer architecture with multi-head attention and positional encodings, to building an efficient training pipeline complete with modern optimizations like flash attention, mixed precision training, and distributed parallelism. We've debugged exploding gradients, optimized memory usage, and watched our model evolve from producing random gibberish to generating coherent text. Along the way, we've gained deep insights into why each component exists and how they work together to create these remarkable language models.\n",

    "I hope this deep dive has been as illuminating for you as it has been for me. Writing this implementation forced me to confront gaps in my own understanding and solidified concepts that previously felt abstract. There's something uniquely satisfying about seeing your hand-built transformer successfully predict its first coherent sentence—a moment where theory truly becomes understanding.\n",

I'd love to hear about your experiences implementing transformers, any bugs you've encountered, optimizations you've discovered, or questions this post might have raised.
