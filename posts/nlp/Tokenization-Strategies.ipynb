    "**Tokenization** is the process of breaking down a string into smaller units of information that will be used by the model. This process sometimes involves some preprocessing steps such as converting to lowercase, [stemming & lemmatization](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/stemming-and-lemmatization-1.html), etc. There are many tokenizations strategies that each has its own advantages and drawbacks. We will first give a brief introduction of the different steps involved in the tokenization process. Then we'll consider the two *extreme* and easy tokenization strategies: *character tokenization* and *word tokenization*. Finally, we will discuss subword tokenizations where statistical methods and language heuristics are used to learn the optimal splitting of words such as WordPiece and SentencePiece tokenizers."

    "Tokenization process involves 4 steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Normalizations*: This is the first step where a set of operations are applied to a raw text to make it cleaner. Such operations may include [Unicode Normalization](https://unicode.org/reports/tr15/), lowercasing.\n",
    "- *Pretokenization*: This step involves splitting the normalized text into words. For languages like English and German, splitting on whitespaces and punctuations work really well. However, some languages such as Japanese and Chinese don't have whitespace character and we would be better off using language-specific tokenizer.\n",
    "- *Tokenizer*: This step applies subword splitting model such as [WordPiece](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08144v2) and [SentencePiece](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06226). The subword model would be learned/trained on the pretrained corpus.\n",
    "- *Postprocessing*: This is the last step where some additional tokens will be added to each sequence. For exampe, BERT tokenizer add `[CLS]` to the beginning of the sequence and `[SEP]` to separate two sequence. On the other hands, XLM-R adds `<s>` to indicate the beginning of a sequence and `</s>` to indicate the end of the sequence."

    "**NB**: When using pretrained models such as DistilBERT, we must use the same tokenizer that the model used during training. Otherwise, what the model assumes token_id = 1 is will be completely different that what the new token_id = 1 represents. It has the same effect as shuffling the vocabulary."
