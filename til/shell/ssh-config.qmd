We can use `config` file under `~/.ssh/` to host ssh login information for
different servers to avoid typing them every time we want to `ssh` into such
servers. Below are few examples of such configs:

```bash
Host vm
    User foobar
    HostName 172.16.174.141
    Port 2222
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    RemoteForward 9999 localhost:8888

# Configs can also take wildcards
Host *.company.com
    User foobaz
```
