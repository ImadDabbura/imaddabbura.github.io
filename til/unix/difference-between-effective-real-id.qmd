Real `UID`/`GID` are attributes of the user that are set at login by login
shell. They typyically stay the same.

Effective `UID`/`GID` are attributes of a process that are used when checking
access permissions for operations on files or commands.

Real and effective are typyically the same, but sometimes they change when the
executable file have it's set-user-ID bit on. This happens, for example, when a
program needs root or other higher level permissions to perform some operations
on behalf of the user such as `cron` program.
