We can compare branches/tags/time ranges/etc. on Github by modifying the URL of
the Github repository and appending `/compare` to the URL such as
`https://github.com/ImadDabbura/cmn_ai/compare`. This will take us to
a new page that allows us to compare between different commits. It is very
useful way to visualize changes betweem branches/tags or just even time ranges.
