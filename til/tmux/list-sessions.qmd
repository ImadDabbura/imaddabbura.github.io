To list all the tmux sessions that are currently running, you can type `tmux ls` in the command-line which is a shortcut for `tmux list-sessions`.

If you're within a tmux session, `prefix-w` would list the tree of all sessions and the windows/panes withing each session. This is very handy to toggle between sessions/windows.
