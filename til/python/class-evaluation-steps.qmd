Python follows roughly the following steps when evaluating a class definition:

- Reads the body of the class from top to bottom
- Create instances of the descriptors (if any) and bound them to the class
attributes
- Calls `type.__new__` to create the new object
- Calls `__set_name__` on each descriptor (if any)
- Calls `__init_subclass__` for all superclasses
- Applies class descorators (if any)
