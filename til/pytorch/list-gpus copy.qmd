The main steps the pytorch `DataLoader` follows when loading a batch of data, from a high level, are as follows:

- If `BatchSampler` is provided, it uses it to get batch of indices; otherwise, it uses `Sampler`, `batch_size`, and `drop_last` to get get the batch of indices
- Get the items from the dataset using the above indices
- If `collate_fn` is provided, it uses it on the items returned from the dataset; otherwise, it uses the `default_collate` function to get the final output on each iteration
