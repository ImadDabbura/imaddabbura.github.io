```sql
SELECT ROW() OVER(PARTITION BY attrib_1 ORDER BY attrib_2)
```
`ROW()`, `RANK()`, and `DENSE_RANK()` all share the same functionality, which
is assigning numbers to tuples inside a *partition* ordered by some
attribute(s). However, they are different in terms of assigning those numbers
in the case of ties:

- `ROW()` assigns numbers incrementally to tuples with the same value(s) in
  a non-deterministic way. In others words, same tuple that share the same value(s)
  with other tuples can have different numbers in different executions in a
  non-deterministic way.
- `RANK()` assigns same number to tuples with the same value(s). Also, there
  will be a gap between the number assigned to tuples with same value(s) and
  the next tuple.
- `DENSE_RANK()` is similar to `RANK()` but doesn't create gaps.
