Sometimes we may want to test scripts that can't be imported as packages and live in different directories than the `tests` directory. The easiest way to make our `src` code directory discoverable at runtime is to update Python's `sys.path`. We can do that through pytest config file as follows:

```ini
[pytest]
...
testpaths = tests
pythonpath = src
...
```
This will add `src` directory to the `sys.path`. This is relative to `pytest.ini` file. Also, by default, pytest add `tests` directory to the `sys.path`, but we're here explicit about what is the `tests` path.
