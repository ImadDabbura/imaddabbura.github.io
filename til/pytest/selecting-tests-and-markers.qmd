We can use the the flag `-m marker_name` to run tests that matched the provided marker name(s). We can also use `()`, `and`, `or`, and `not` to select tests based on markers. However, the name of the markers must be in full and we can't use substrings or part of the marker. This is different from the `-k` flag, which lets us use substrings or part of the test name to run those test.
