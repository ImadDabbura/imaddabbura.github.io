Dynamic hardware partitioning in GPU architectures refers to the ability to
allocate and reallocate GPU resources (such as compute units, memory
bandwidth, or execution queues) to different workloads or tasks at runtime.
Unlike static partitioning, where resources are fixed at launch, dynamic
partitioning enables better utilization and responsiveness by adapting to
workload demands. This is particularly useful in heterogeneous environments
or multi-tenant systems where workloads may vary significantly in compute or
memory intensity. By dynamically reallocating resources, GPUs can reduce
contention, improve throughput, and enhance latency-sensitive performance.
However, the overhead of partition switching and the complexity of resource
management can introduce trade-offs that must be carefully balanced.
Additionally, dynamic partitioning can affect the number of threads running
concurrently depending on resource usage such as register pressure. For
instance, if a workload uses a large number of registers per thread, fewer
threads can be resident per streaming multiprocessor, reducing concurrency.
Conversely, if register usage is low, more threads can run concurrently.
Similarly, large thread blocks may lead to underutilization of resources if
they exceed per-block limits, while smaller thread blocks may allow more
flexibility and better occupancy under dynamic partitioning constraints.
