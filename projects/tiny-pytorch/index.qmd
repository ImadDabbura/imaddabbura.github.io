## Project: `Tiny-PyTorch` â€“ Unraveling Deep Learning's Core

As an **AI scientist**, I firmly believe that a profound understanding of complex systems and algorithms stems from building them from the ground up. This conviction is the driving force behind `Tiny-PyTorch`, an educational deep learning framework crafted entirely in Python. It's my personal quest to demystify the "magic" of modern deep learning by offering a transparent, from-scratch implementation of the essential components found in frameworks like PyTorch.

`Tiny-PyTorch` strips away high-level abstractions, allowing you to **see the core logic** of deep learning principles, **connect theoretical concepts to their concrete computational realizations**, and ultimately **become a more insightful researcher** by understanding the underlying mechanics and inherent trade-offs of the tools that underpin our field.

### Key Highlights:

  * **From Scratch, By Design:** Every fundamental piece, from the **`Tensor` object** and its **dynamic computation graph** to the **reverse-mode automatic differentiation (`autograd`) engine**, is meticulously built from first principles. This provides an unparalleled view into the **mathematical operations** and **computational flow** that drive deep learning.
  * **Modular Architecture:** The project is structured to mirror major deep learning libraries, progressing from low-level **`NDArray` operations** and pluggable hardware backends (NumPy, custom CPU, and CUDA) to higher-level APIs like **`nn.Module`** and standard optimizers (`SGD`, `Adam`). This layered approach illuminates the **architectural considerations** of such frameworks.
  * **Educational Foundation:** It's designed as a practical learning tool to bridge the gap between abstract mathematical concepts and their concrete code implementation, fostering a deeper understanding of **how deep learning truly functions at its core**.
  * **Core Features Implemented:** Includes `Tensor` with `autograd`, an extensible `nn.Module` system, standard optimizers, and a pluggable backend system for hardware acceleration, all constructed to expose their foundational elements.

### Installation:

You can install `Tiny-PyTorch` directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install tiny-pytorch
```
