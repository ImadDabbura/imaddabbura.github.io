I am a big believer in **Boyd's Law**, which states that _speed of iteration beats quality of iteration_. Following this principle, I created `cmn_ai` to incorporate the most common tasks we encounter in ML/AI from data exploration to model development and training. Additionally, I baked into it some of the best practices I learned in my career so I don't have to repeat myself on every project I work on.

It is worth noting that the majority of the DL code such as `Learner` and callbacks assume that [`pytorch`](https://pytorch.org/) is used as the underlying DL library. Also, tabular data preprocessors/models are compatible with [`sklearn`](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) so they can be used easily with its `Pipeline` or `ColumnTransformer`.

Given the nature of the progress in ML/AI, I will always keep adding more functionalities as time passes.
