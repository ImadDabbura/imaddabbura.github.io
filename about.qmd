I am a *DMTS - AI Scientist* with many years of experience in the
field of **Data Science and Machine Learning** where I worked in a variety of
industries such as *Smart Devices, Consumer Goods, Real Estate, Marketing, and Healthcare*.

Among other things, I am interested in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I write articles related to machine learning and AI on [*Medium*](https://medium.com/@ImadPhd) and contribute to open source.

Human potential has no limits and Iâ€™m always trying to constantly learn and improve myself. I hope you find the contents of my website useful.
