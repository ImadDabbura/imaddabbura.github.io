## Activity of Reading

We don't have to know everything about a topic to understand it well. Knowing too much is as bad as knowing too little. The key is to _understand_ key ideas/milestones really well.

Reading in its nature is an activity -> Passive consumption of information IS NOT reading. You need to actively think and analyze new information and connect it with what you know. The level of activity and participation in reading any new information determines determines how well you are in understanding it.

- Especially with hard books, it require hard mental operations and it is tough
- The reward is that the mind moves from knowing less to knowing more through understanding

There is a big difference between reading to increase information we know about a topic (adding more facts to what we already know) and reading to improve our understanding (create mental models, connect it to what we know, internalize it, understand it through derivation and connection from different angles)

- We start from writer being superior than reader on the topic -> Converge to
  equality as reader's understanding improves
- We need to know when when, why, and how it applies and our push back (critique). To understand something means to know:
  - Its connections with other facts
  - Its contrasts
  - Conditions for it to hold

In conclusion, reading a book for understanding is like learning through
discovery because we are left alone with the book to explore and interrogate
by reading between the lines, using our imagination/reflection to connect it
with facts we already know about the topic AND construct its
logic/analogy/contradiction.

## Levels of Reading

**Elementary reading:** Answering what does the sentence say (surface level
meaning) without any much thinking

**Inspectional reading:** Reading a book in a very short period of time to get
its structure, type, parts to obtain a surface level understanding

**Analytical reading:** Reading for deep understanding where we ask very deep
and organized questions to get to the bottom of what it was set to deliver

**Synotopical reading:** Read many books about a subject to construct an
analysis and connection about it that doesn't exist in one book. It is the
hardest and requires the most effort

We must always do inspectional reading first before any analytical reading
regardless of our goal. This would help us prime the brain of what to expect
and be ready for new information

> Some books are to be tasted (majority)
> Others to be swallowed (minority)
> Very few to be chewed and digested

## Inspectional Reading

### Systematic Skimming

It is extremely helpful because it helps us figure out what the book is all
about and what it has to offer. Most books don't deserve analytical reading and
inspectional reading is enough to get its main idea/contribution which would
save us a lot of time by not reading it cover-to-cover. It should NOT take more
than _1 hour_.

Steps for systematic skimming:

- Read the _title/subtitle_
- Read the _table of content_ carefully. If the book has a detailed table of
  content, read it as well. We can get the structure of the books from TOC
- Read the _index_. It tells us the range of topics covered and books/authors
  referred by the author. It would be helpful to read some paragraphs in the
  book where important terms were mentioned
- Read the _plurb_. Authors sometimes summarize the main point(s) in the plurb
- Read summaries of critical chapters of the book
- Turn the pages and read randomly some paragraphs/pages
- Read the epilogue of main parts as authors typically summarize their contribution

### Superficial Reading

Read the book through without stopping to understand or lookup anything. Very
useful for hard and difficult books such as The Wealth of Nations. We can get
the big picture that will help us during our second pass for analytical reading

## Demanding Reader

Important and hard books make a big difference in the rate of improving your
understanding and increasing the facts we know about their domain. They help
tremendously in creating mental models and thinking from first principles. They
stretch our mind and we need to raise to their level of mastery to be able to
ask the right questions and engage with the reading.

The goal of active reading is answering the following questions:

1. What is the books about?
   - Main theme/ideas and their subtopics in their order
2. Main ideas/arguments/assertions?
   - What is being said in details and how?
3. Is the book all true? Which parts?
   - You should make up your mind and NOT just adopt author's msg
4. Significance of information presented
   - Question the significance of information and whether it is important

Inspectional reading helps us answer the first two questions while analytical
reading helps us answer the last two questions.

Reading between the lines is very crucial in getting the most out of the
material. Also, writing down the questions and answers would improve
understanding and alertness.

You should always be critical and question the information you read after
understanding it.

Marking books:

- Underline important points
- Vertical lines to emphasize a statement or paragraph too long to underline
- Fold or have a mark on top of the page for the most important thing(s) in the
  book. Use it sparsely
- Numbers in the margin for the points the author is using to build his argument
- Numbers of other pages the cover the same point or contradict it
- Write in the margin for Q/A and conclusion for important points in your own
  words
- Use first page for each chapter to outline main point and its structure and
  your understanding
- Use first pages in the book to outline main points and structure of the book
- Use last few pages as index for the main points in the book in their order

## Analytical Reading

### Stage I: Rules for finding out what is the book about

**RULE 1:** You must classify the book we are reading as early as possible and
preferably before reading it (inspectional reading)

**RULE 2:** State the structure/unity of the book in one or few sentences. We
typically can do this by reading the title/subtitle, preface, table of
contents, and the introduction.

**RULE 3:** State the major parts the form the structure and how they are
interrelated and contribute to the overall structure. We can outline the parts,
the parts of the parts, etc. but we typically approximate and stick to the
first level unless there is a need to dig deeper.

**RULE 4:** Find out what the author's problems are. We must be able to
determine the main points and main questions the authors are trying to
investigate.

### Stage II: Rules for interpreting the book's contents

**RULE 5:** Find out the important words and what the author means from using
such words. We can depend on our daily use of the language to understand the
majority of the words in the text. However, there are few words that require
special attention that would typically have subtle meanings or the author has
specific meaning that he wants to come across to the reader mind.

**RULE 6:** Find out the most important sentence and figure out their
propositions. Most authors make it clear about the importance of certain
sentences and words through their use of style, marks, and order.

**RULE 7:** Construct the basic arguments from connecting the most important
sentences. Arguments can either start with conclusion followed by evidence(s)
or the other way around

**RULE 8:** Find out what the author's solutions are.

### Stage III: Rules for criticizing a book as a communication of knowledge

**RULE 9:** You must always understand before judging any work or written
material. We must always critique the book and provide our own judgement after
understanding the author's main point(s) and arguments. Otherwise, you are just
a consumer and have no opinion. Critiquing doesn't mean disagreeing. You can
agree with the author, but you have to use your own logic and words to express
why you agree with the author.

**RULE 10:** When you disagree, do so reasonably.

Author soundedness:

- _Uninformed_: Lack knowledge that was revealed after his work
- _Misinformed_: Argue with things that are false
- _Illogical_: Reasoning over some facts don't hold or don't lead to the
  conclusion arrived by the author

Therefore, in the case of disagreeing with the author(s), we need to show where
the author is:

- Uninformed
- And/Or misinformed
- And/Or illogical
- And/Or his analysis is incomplete

## Synotopical Reading

Syntopical reading means reading many books on the same subject and comparing
them to construct your own understanding or framework, rather than accepting
any single author’s version of truth.

Therefore, the goal is to analyze a problem or idea across multiple authors and
develop your own synthesis of the issue.

## Reading and Growth Mindset

Regardless of how good a reader you are, there will always be books that are
beyond your reach and require effort to understand them.

Reading for more information would lead to increase information about facts we
already know. It doesn't improve our understanding because improving our
understanding requires a change in our brain by adding more facts and
connections to concepts/topics.

There is NO limit for the growth of the mind.

Mind can and will deteriorate if not challenged and stretched regularly.

## Advise

- It is important to not stop at words/phrases you don't understand and keep
  going by trying to get the meaning from the context.
- Vary speed of reading according to the complexity of the information. Even
  within the same book, some chapters/paragraphs must be read at different
  speeds.
- Brain is faster than eyes in comprehending new information. Use fingers to
  avoid such limitations, increase focus, and improve speed
- Always use your own words when summarizing, explaining, or even stating main
  points. DO NOT USE AUTHOR'S WORDS.
